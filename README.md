Adiabatic/Polytropic 2D reactor simulation and optimization scripts

Code bundles in this repository simulates and optimizes a multitubular pseudo-homogeneous chemical reactor with a 2D temperature dependence. Please see README files in specific folders for further explanation.

Adiabatic reactor simulation: Stead-state simulation of a chemical reactor in adiabatic operation (no heat to surroundings). Reaction kinetics and input conditions should be specified by the user prior to simulation.

Adiabatic reactor optimization: Optimization of a chemical reactor in adiabatic operation. Parameters to be optimized, parameter bounds (min, max, initial) and objective function to be minimized (e.g. -yield,-conversion) should be specified by the user.

Polytropic reactor simulation: Stead-state simulation of a chemical reactor in polytropic operation (coolant outside of tubes). Reaction kinetics and input conditions should be specified by the user prior to simulation.

Polytropic reactor optimization: Optimization of a chemical reactor in polytropic operation. Parameters to be optimized, parameter bounds (min, max, initial) and objective function to be minimized (e.g. -yield,-conversion) should be specified by the user.
